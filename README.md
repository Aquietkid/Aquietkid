## 👨‍💻 Languages & Technologies I Know:

C++: The powerhouse of performance and my _first love_ in coding!

Java: Writing robust applications and diving deep into the world of OOP and software architecture.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, ExpressJS: Crafting webpages, bringing them to life, and handling the server-side.

MySQL & MS SQL Server: Managing databases and ensuring data integrity.
## 🌱 Currently Exploring:

Unity Game Development: Making engaging yet meaningful games in 2D or 3D environments, including C# scripting. 

Python: Well, we all know what it's for. (everything)

Advanced Web Development: ReactJS, MongoDB, and more.
