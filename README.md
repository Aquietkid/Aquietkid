## Hey there 👋
Thanks for stopping here, I'm thrilled to see you! I'm a software engineering student who's forever-ready to learn and create. Let's get to know me: 

## 👨‍💻 Languages & Technologies I Know:

C++: The powerhouse of performance and my _first love_ in coding!

Java: Writing robust applications and diving deep into the world of OOP and software architecture.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, ExpressJS: Crafting webpages, bringing them to life, and handling the server-side.

Advanced Web Development: ReactJS, MongoDB, and more.

Unity Game Development: Making engaging yet meaningful games in 2D or 3D environments, including C# scripting. 

Python: Well, we all know what it's for. (everything)

AI/ML: Training ML models to detect patterns and make predictions; exploring theoretical AI

XAI: Explaining AI decisions to help build trust and ensure fair decision-making

## 🌱 Currently Exploring:

Jenkins: Setting up auto-deployment and build generation pipelines for CI/CD
