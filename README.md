## Hey there 👋

Thanks for stopping here, I'm thrilled to see you! I'm a final year software engineering student who's forever-ready to learn and build. Let's get to know me:

## What I Love to Do:

I love making software that benefits individuals like you and I. Something to ease their lives, provide peace of mind, or some fun when you need it.

I also love using code to solve my own problems. From making scripts that automate something I did manually to making a little app to see how rotating an image makes phenakistiscopes work. Not just that, I love making mobile apps that solve problems I have had in my daily life. (I am building an interesting app that solves such a problem, and I hope to release it soon. If you want to join its beta, just leave me an email. Stay tuned for updates.)

## 👨‍💻 Languages & Technologies I Know:

C++: The powerhouse of performance and my _first love_ in coding!

Java: Writing robust applications and diving deep into the world of OOP and software architecture.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, ExpressJS: Crafting webpages, bringing them to life, and handling the server-side.

Advanced Web Development: ReactJS, MongoDB, and more.

MySQL, MS SQL Server, MongoDB: Managing databases and ensuring data integrity.

Unity Game Development: Making engaging yet meaningful games in 2D or 3D environments, including C# scripting.

Python: Well, we all know what it's for. (everything)

AI/ML: Training ML models to detect patterns and make predictions; exploring theoretical AI

## 🌱 Currently Exploring:

Kotlin/Jetpack Compose: Making native Android applications that perform

XAI: Explaining AI decisions to help build trust and ensure fair decision-making

Jenkins: Setting up auto-deployment and build generation pipelines for CI/CD

Linux Shell Scripting: Daily-driving Ubuntu and automating common tasks with custom shell scripts

Embedded Software Engineering: Programming Arduino boards and ESP32 and interfacing with sensors, motors, and LCD displays

## 🚀 Beyond Coding:

I love physics and astronomy, psychology, philosophy, books, and caffeine. I also love photography as it helps find beauty in the mundane of daily life. I love putting pen to paper and fingers to keyboard.
